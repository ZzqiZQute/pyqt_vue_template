## Install
```bash
    pip3 install pyside2
    cd frontend
    yarn (npm -i)
    # Need to install vue and its dependencies, qwebchannel
```

## Debug

```bash
    cd frontend
    yarn serve (npm run serve)
    cd ..
    python3 mainwindow.py
```

## Usage

The `Comm` class is used to keep communication between JavaScript and Python. You can add some signals and slots just like that how `PySide2` is used. 

In the template, A slot which name is `log` is added to show how to use this in Python.

At the front end, an webchannel is generated by the `qwebchannl` library. You can use the `channel` module to get the communication object. The `channel` module export a `Promise`, it'll resolve an object which contains some functions. The name of these functions are same as the name of the slots defined in the `Comm` class. So just call it, then the Python side will call the corresponded slot.

You can also define some signals on the Python side, then emit them. At the front end, the object which the `channel` module exported will contains the signals object in it. The signal object contains a function named `connect`, and the argument of the function is an other function. The other function is like the slot in PySide2. When the correspond signal is emitted, the function (slot) is called. The work pattern is similar to the work pattern in PySide2.

## Notice

- Test in windows system. If run this in the terminal of the Qt IDE, the `print` function may echo nothing at the `slots` until the program stop. So you may need to use `flush=True` in the `**kwargs` of function `print`.
